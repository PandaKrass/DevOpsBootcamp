DB types:
    - Key/Values:
      Redis,  Memcached, etcd (k8s)
      Unique keys. Read the data via keys. Fast, work from RAM. Used for caching or message queue.
    - Wide Columns:
      Cassandra, Apache HBase
      Same idea just more columns. Schema-less - any value types any amount of columns. Handle large unstructured data.
    - Document Databases:
      MongoDB, DynamoDB (AWS), CouchBase
      Storing data in a documents which grouped in collections and the last can have hierarchy. Schema-less - slower than previous.
      Used for mobile app (games) etc. Can be a primary DB.
    - Relation DBs
      Mysql, Postgresql
      Structured DB and needs a schema to be predefined. Uses SQL. Tables are related, duplication avoided by  if references.
      Most popular. ACID. Hard to scale.
    - Graph DBs
      Neo4j, Dgraph
      Uses nodes and edges. Used for graphs, patterns, recommendations.
    - Search DBs
      ElasticSearch, Solr
      Similar to documents DBs but creates the indexes for data combinations to fasten the results.
